Q2: What is the escape velocity of Earth?
Status: EXTERNAL_0.95
Answer: The escape velocity of Earth is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second (km/s) or 25,000 miles per hour (mph). This is the minimum speed an object must have to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and leave its atmosphere without further propulsion.

Q3: Why is gravity weaker on the Moon compared to Earth?
Status: EXTERNAL_0.98
Answer: Gravity is weaker on the Moon compared to Earth because the Moon has a smaller mass and radius than the Earth. According to the universal law of gravitation, the strength of gravity depends on the mass of the object and the distance from its center. The Moon's mass is about 1/81 of the Earth's mass, and its radius is about 1/4 of the Earth's radius. As a result, the surface gravity on the Moon is about 1/6 of the surface gravity on Earth, which is why astronauts can jump higher on the Moon than on Earth.
