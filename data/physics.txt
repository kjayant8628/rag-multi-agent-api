[FACT: PRINCIPLE]
In classical mechanics, all objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum regardless of their mass.
This principle was demonstrated by Galileo Galilei and is explained by Newton’s laws of motion.

The gravitational force acting on an object is proportional to its mass, described by the equation F = mg,
where m is mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. When calculating acceleration (a = F / m),
the mass cancels out, resulting in the same acceleration for all objects.

[FACT: EXPERIMENT]
This means that in the absence of air resistance, a feather and a hammer will fall at the same rate.
This phenomenon was famously demonstrated on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission.
